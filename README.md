# photogram_myself
Detailed Notes about how to do photogrammetry with command line based open source software.

## Preparation
- a colorful color checker\
the color checker is *X-Rite ColorChecker Passport Photo 2* in this case
- a black and white color checker
- a set of photos from different angles and focus distances\ 
*a single flower of Pedicularis cranolopha in this case*

## I. Color calibration
**1. OpenCV**
- install
```bash
conda install opencv
````
- use

**2. PlantCV**
- install





Notes: 
Definitely we can do it by Adobe Lightroom with a user-edited color profile with a XRite Color Checker Passport.Lrplugin. ~800 photos takes ~0.5 hours. However, there is no command line version of this software, and it can become very repetitive if we have more than ten sets of photos to deal with (with 10 times of clicks and waiting for the results)

## II. Cluster photos by angles


## III. Focus stacking


## IV. Remove the background of photos


## V. Build Mesh Model
